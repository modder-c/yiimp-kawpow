## yiimp-kawpow rev.2

accepts shares and submits blocks, but is provided as is.

just like any custom yiimp stratum; this code is intended to run kawpow-algorithm coins as per ravencoin's kawpow definition (no variants).
additionally this code can run firopow-algorithm coins as per firo's firopow definition (as above).
c
stratum maintains a separate pow cache/context per coin, so running multiple kawpow/firopow coins wont cause any issue.
